            Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 – December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice Wrld (pronounced "juice world"; stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter, born in Chicago, Illinois. His song "Lucid Dreams" has been played on the music streaming platform Spotify over one billion Times. "Lucid Dreams" and his earlier hit single "All Girls Are the Same" helped him gain a recording contract with Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions and Interscope Records.

            <h3>Why I created this website?</h3>
            <p>
        I created this website as my project for Computer Networks & Databases held by dr hab. inż. Joanna Iwaniec and chose Juice WRLD as a topic, in his memory because he was my favorite artist, who tragically past away recently as a 21 year old. </p>
