                <h2>Why I created this website?</h2>



              <p>

I created this website as my project for Computer Networks & Databases held by dr hab. inż. Joanna Iwaniec and chose Juice WRLD as a topic, in his memory because he was my favorite artist, who tragically past away recently as a 21 year old. On this website you can find my reports from laboratories (below), links to Juice WRLD’s Spotify, Youtube and Instagram, descriptions and logos of his 3 albums and short history of his sadly, too short career. If you cannot find SQL and PHP, SQL database is in subpage Career, thank you for visiting and have a good day.
</p>


    <h2>Why Juice WRLD?</h2>

    <p>
Juice WRLD was incredible, versitale and very talented artist who combined two genres (hip hop and rock) his most popular song:   ,,Lucid Dreams” was created on a sample of Sting’s all time classic: ,,Shape of my heart”. I was a big fan even before he ,,blew up” and became world wide famous and recognizable. I don’t have any partnership with him or his sites, so all links take you to home websites. Fill in my questionare about your favorite Juice WRLD’s song, because I am curious which people like the most, thank you for visiting this website and i hope you liked it.
